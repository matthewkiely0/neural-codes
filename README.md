# neural-codes
Programmes written on the theme of neural codes (continuation of undergrad 'final year project'). Neural codes are sets of binary codewords that capture neural activity. Mathematical tools called neural ideals are developed to characterise an associated space called the stimulus space. 

The theory of neural ideals (and neural rings, which are closely related) was originally developed by Carina Curto et.al. (see Carina Curto et al. The neural ring: an algebraic tool for analyzing the intrinsic structure of neural codes. Bulletin of Mathematical Biology et al., 2013)
